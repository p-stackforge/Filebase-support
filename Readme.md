## 🧠 Overview

Filebase is a private, high-performance file search app for Windows. It pre-indexes and extracts content from monitored folders in the background (using Lucene + Tika/OCR), returns near-instant search results, and keeps all data local so your files never leave your device.

## 🛠️ How to Install / How to Use

1. Download the beta from the official website or the Download page.
2. Install on Windows 10/11 (requires .NET runtime).
